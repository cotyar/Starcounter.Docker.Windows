&lt;starcounter-include&gt; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Starcounter/starcounter-include.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Starcounter/starcounter-include)
==============

`<starcounter-include>` is a custom element that let's you load HTML partials into your Starcounter page, it uses  

- [`<imported-template>`](https://github.com/Juicy/imported-template) - You can take full control over loaded `<script>`s and `<link rel="import">`s. Thanks to HTML Imports - caching, script execution, etc. is completely native.
- [`<juicy-composition>`](https://github.com/Juicy/juicy-composition) - You can use Shadow DOM v1 features to apply Document Fragment with custom HTML composition and slots to tune the layout of HTML Elements given by partial. It lets you blend and apply your desired look & feel to elements given by your and even other apps - which were mixed due to Starcounter mappings.

### Small sample

If you have **/app/sub/page/path.html**:
```html
<template>
	<h1>Hello {{username}}</h1>
</template>
```
and JSON view-model
```javascript
SubPageViewModel = {
  username: "World"
  html: "/app/sub/page/path.html"
}
```
You can put it on screen with
```html
<starcounter-include partial="{{ SubPageViewModel }}"></starcounter-include>
```
To produce
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

### HTML Partial limitations

 - It should be W3C compliant Document body,
 - It should contain at least one `<template>` tag in root node.

### Partial conventions

 - View-model contains `Html` property with path to file (:construction:, or just inline markup).

## Install

Starcounter has it already pre-installed, under `/sys/starcounter-include/starcounter-include.html`, but if you want to use it separately as well.

Install the component using [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
$ bower install starcounter-include --save
```

Or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/Starcounter/starcounter-include/archive/master.zip).

## Usage

1. Import Web Components' polyfill (if needed):

    ```html
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js"></script>
    ```

2. Import Custom Element:

    ```html
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/starcounter-include/starcounter-include.html">
    ```

3. Start using it!

    ```html
    <starcounter-include partial="{{ViewModel}}"></starcounter-include>
    ```
    or without mustache-style data-binding:
    ```js
    document.querySelector("starcounter-include").partial = ViewModel;
    ```
    or with inline JSON:
    ```html
    <starcounter-include partial="{&quot;Html&quot;: &quot;/path/to/file.html&quot;, &quot;some&quot;: &quot;data&quot;}"></starcounter-include>
    ```
